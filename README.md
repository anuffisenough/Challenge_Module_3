# Challenge_Module_3

## Description

-This project aimed to add functionality to a password generating webpage.

-Using the provided starter code, window prompts were added to request input from the user in order to determine password length and character type(s).

-Each input was stored as a variable to be called upon later in determining the appropriate function(s) to generate an acceptable password.

-User input is validated, and a specific function is called to create a password that meets the desired criteria.

-The final password is generated, and will appear in the text area of the "Your Secure Password" box.
